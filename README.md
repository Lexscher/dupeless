# No Dupes

A shell script that was built to remove duplicate lines/text from a file.

## Usage

**Hold for Usage**

### Note

This uses some features that are only available with bash v4.0 and beyond.

We can run `bash --version` to see if we're up to date.

Not up to date, yet? Then we can run `brew install bash`, and we should be all set.

And we can always double check

```s
$ bash --version

[This blog post](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba) explains everything very well.
